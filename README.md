# surfs_up

## Project Overview
The goal is to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu during the months of June and December. Doing so will support whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The query will specifically state temperatures for the months of June and December, this provides critical information such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. 

## Resources
-   Software: Python 3.9.12 
-   Jupyter Notebooks

## Results
### June Temperature
Based on the analysis, there are 1,700 observations for the months of June. This includes the years between 2010 and 2017. The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are listed below. The low standard deviation implies a relatively small spread across the temperature observations. This makes sense, as Oahu weather does not seem to fluctuate significantly.

###  December Temperature
December, has less observations than June at 1,517. This indicates that some of the dates are missing temperature recordings. Even so, the sample size is still large and does not impact drastically. According to the charts, June and December are close in average, maximum, and minimum temperature. More importantly, the spread is about the same as the spread for the month of June.

## Summary
1.  Comparing the overall summary for the two months, temperature patterns remain steady throughout the whole year. However, there are two more queries that  need to be included in order to get a better understanding of the weather on Oahu. Although temperatures may remain about the same throughout the year, the number of rainy days may have a significant impact on the business success. Doing a statistically summary of the precipitation patterns during the months of June and December will provide a complete understanding of the overall weather pattern. 

2.  A second query can help by comparing the most active stations to the weather patterns. The best location can be determined by cross-referencing the most popular station with the highest weather stability.
